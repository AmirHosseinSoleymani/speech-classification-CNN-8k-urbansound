# 🎙️ Speech Classification with CNN - UrbanSound8K

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for classifying urban sound events using the **UrbanSound8K** dataset. The model leverages deep learning techniques to accurately categorize different environmental sounds such as sirens, dog barks, and car horns.

## 📂 Dataset - UrbanSound8K
**UrbanSound8K** is a dataset containing **8,732 labeled audio files** across **10 sound classes**:
- Air Conditioner
- Car Horn
- Children Playing
- Dog Bark
- Drilling
- Engine Idling
- Gun Shot
- Jackhammer
- Siren
- Street Music

## 📖 Model Architecture - CNN for Audio Classification
The model utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **Mel-Spectrograms** as input features. The key layers include:
- **Convolutional Layers** (Feature Extraction)
- **Batch Normalization & Dropout** (Regularization)
- **Fully Connected Layers** (Classification)
- **Softmax Activation** (Multi-class prediction)

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Experiment with **different CNN architectures** (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Implement **attention mechanisms** for better feature learning
- Deploy as a **real-time classification app**
